# SurvivalOfTheFittest2
Updated version of Survival of the Fittest. (because I didn't know what branches were)

## Description
SurvivalOfTheFittest is a project that utilizes the genetic algorithm to create a scenario in which prey must avoid being
eaten by the predators. In the simulation, only the prey currently utilize the genetic algorithm while the predators follow
a simple algorithmic AI pattern.

## Features
- Prey units controled by genetic algorithm.
- Predator units that kill the prey.
- Generational simulations that implement succesful genes from past generations.
- Scoreboard to keep track of the generation, number of living prey, and top score.
## Future Plans
- add effects and general polish.
- make the predators starve if they don't eat enough (not certain).
